# Analysis of Nucleic Acid Sequences
## Andrew Tweedell, Ameya Gokhale

This Analysis of Nucleic Acid Sequences Python package aims to enable life scientists to translate and analyze DNA or RNA sequences. As gene sequencing becomes cheaper and faster and computational power increases, the ability to produce insight from statistical analyses on large sets of genetic data will become more relevant. Specific segments of DNA called genes, are used to generate an RNA sequence in a process called transcription. This RNA is then used as a template in the synthesis of amino acids called translation. This package first aims to determine whether an input sequence of nucleotides is a DNA (for purposes of this project it is assumed that the input DNA will be a single antisense string) or RNA sequence and then returns a basic analysis of the nucleotides in the sequence. Secondly, the specific amino acid sequence that will result from the DNA or RNA strand will be determined.
